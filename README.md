# Altair-Visualization-Demo
### Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on Vega and Vega-Lite.

With Altair, you can spend more time understanding your data and its meaning. Altairâ€™s API is simple, friendly and consistent and built on top of the powerful Vega-Lite visualization grammar. This elegant simplicity produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal amount of code.

Altair can be installed, along with the example datastes in vega_datasets, using:
$ pip install altair vega_datasets

If you are using the conda package manager, the equivalent is:
$ conda install -c conda-forge altair vega_datasets
