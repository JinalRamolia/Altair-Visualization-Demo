Python provides a lot of libraries, specifically for plotting and visualization and I usually have a tough time picking out which one to use for my problem statement.

I recently come across with Altair, a visualization library in Python and I was amazed by its capabilities. It is a very user-friendly library which actually performs a lot of things with the minimal amount of code.

Please note that Altair is still in development phase, so things might change over time. We can still do a lot of exciting work on it and the future potential really excites me
